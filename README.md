## Java Library to create pdf

GlobalReports is a framework for writing PDF. It consists of a suite of programs that allow customers to graphically design the printing layout, and then interpreted by the library Global Report, which will output the final document in PDF format.

Thanks to GlobalReports the programmer will be relieved from having to write a code to create a pdf file, as it happens with other libraries, and especially will not have to worry about having to handle text and images graphic alignments and page breaks in case of text uploaded in run-time, which are the most laborious functions in the writing phase of softwares. The only thing required is to define the layout using the easy GRX markup language, after that, everything else is done by GlobalReports!
